I would like to invite you to dinner at my home on ${new Date().toLocaleString()}. It would be wonderful to have you join me for an evening of good food and great conversation.

I have planned a special menu for the evening and I hope you will enjoy it. We can catch up on old times and discuss our shared interests.

Please let me know if you are able to make it. I look forward to hearing from you and hopefully, having you over for dinner.

Warm regards,

Aoun Malik   `;
